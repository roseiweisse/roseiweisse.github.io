    <h1>What does the Church teach about Poverty?</h1>
    <h5>The Roman Catholic Church is often criticised for its wealth when so many people live in absolute poverty. The Church owns valuable property and art. Some argue that it should give more of its wealth away to the less fortunate. However, some
      Christians argue that the Bible teaches that there is nothing wrong with wealth in itself. It is greed that is wrong.

      The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the poor represent those who are marginalised in society. Jesus himself taught the importance of helping those who are poor and need help. The Church also teaches about the 'preferential option for the
      poor', that in order to improve life for the poor, we should speak for the voiceless and defend the defenceless. </h5>
    <h1>What does this mean in practice?</h1>
    <h5>Christians should act with compassion to less fortunate people. They believe that life is sacred and that God loves every human being. Christians apply these beliefs to the question of wealth and poverty in different ways.</h5>

      <h1>CST on Poverty:</h1>
      <h5>Consideration of poverty in Catholic social teaching begins with the foundation that each person is both sacred and social, created in God’s image, and destined to share in the goods of the earth as part of a community of justice and mercy. From the time of the Deuteronomic laws, the covenant, and the prophets, there was special mention of the poor and their privileged place in the community. The Lord frequently warned the Israelites about their duty to the poor: You shall not molest or oppress an alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt. You shall not wrong any widow or orphan (Exod 22:20-22). Their special status reflected a combination of powerlessness, poverty, and systemic exclusion from the community.</h5>

      <h1>What is Poverty?</h1>
      <p><span><strong><em>Poverty</em></strong></span> is the state of <span><strong><em>not having enough</em></strong></span> material possessions or income for a person's basic needs. Poverty may include social, economic, and political elements.
        Absolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter. </p>
      <h1>What are the different forms of Poverty?</h1>
      <p>1. <span><strong><em>Situational poverty</em></strong></span> is generally caused by a sudden crisis or loss and is often temporary. Events causing situational poverty include environmental disasters, divorce, or severe health problems. <br>
        2. <span><strong><em>Generational poverty</em></strong></span> occurs in families where at least two generations have been born into poverty. Families living in this type of poverty are not equipped with the tools to move out of their
        situations.
        <br>
        3. <span><strong><em>Absolute poverty</em></strong></span>, which is rare in the United States, involves a scarcity of such necessities as shelter, running water, and food. Families who live in absolute poverty tend to focus on day-to-day
        survival. <br>
        4. <span><strong><em>Relative poverty</em></strong></span> refers to the economic status of a family whose income is insufficient to meet its society's average standard of living. <br>
        5. <span><strong><em>Urban poverty</em></strong></span> occurs in metropolitan areas with populations of at least 50,000 people. The urban poor deal with a complex aggregate of chronic and acute stressors (including crowding, violence, and
        noise)
        and are dependent on often-inadequate large-city services. <br>
        6. <span><strong><em>Rural poverty</em></strong></span> occurs in nonmetropolitan areas with populations below 50,000. In rural areas, there are more single-guardian households, and families often have less access to services, support for
        disabilities, and quality education opportunities. Programs to encourage transition from welfare to work are problematic in remote rural areas, where job opportunities are few (Whitener, Gibbs, & Kusmin, 2003). The rural poverty rate is
        growing
        and has exceeded the urban rate every year since data collection began in the 1960s. The difference between the two poverty rates has averaged about 5 percent for the last 30 years, with urban rates near 10–15 percent and rural rates near
        15–20
        percent (Jolliffe, 2004).

          <h1>Just how much of the world is suffering with poverty?</h1>
          <p>Recent estimates for global poverty are that 9.2% of the world, or 689
            million people, live in extreme poverty on $1.90 or less a day, according
            to the World Bank. These numbers are calculated based on income and a
            person’s ability to meet basic needs. However, when looking beyond income
            to people experiencing deprivation in health, education, and living
            standards, 1.3 billion people in 107 developing countries are
            multidimensionally poor, according to a 2020 report by the U.N.
            Development Program.</p>

          <h1>Who are these vast majorities?</h1>
          <p>As we can see, today, Africa is the continent with the largest
            number of people living in extreme poverty. The breakdown by
            continent is as follows: <br>
            383 Million in Africa <br>
            327 Million in Asia<br>
            19 Million in South America <br>
            13 Million in North America <br>
            2.5 Million in Oceania <br>
            0.7 Million in Europe <br>
            We can also see that India is the country with the largest number of
            people living in extreme poverty (218 million people), with Nigeria and
            the Congo (DRC) following with 86 and 55 million people, respectively. <br>
            These figures are the result of important changes across time. As we
            mentioned above in our discussion of regional trends, in 1990 Asia was
            the world region with the largest number of poor people (505 million in
            South Asia, plus 966 million in East Asia and the Pacific). However,
            with rapid economic growth in Asia over the past two decades, poverty
            in Asia fell more rapidly than in Africa.

          <h1>Verdict:</h1>
          <p>As we can observe, the majority of people living here in earth are
            living in poverty. We can see the majority more on the eastern part of
            the world. A world where there is no Poverty is a world where Social
            Justice is achieved.</p>
